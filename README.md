## Known issues

### Multiple copies of React

While UI Kit has it's own development environment, it can also be used as a local dependency while developing other projects. This situation may result in errors due to UI Kit having it's own copy of React.

To solve this issue:

1. Go to project's React package
```
cd node_modules/react
```

2. Create a link
```
yarn link
```

3. Go to project's UI Kit package
```
cd node_modules/@reef-defi/ui-kit
```

4. Link React
```
yarn link react
```

These steps might need to be repeated upon managing packages. The issue occurs only in development.
